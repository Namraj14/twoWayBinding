# Explanation of Two-Way Data Binding in Your LWC File

Your Lightning Web Component demonstrates **two-way data binding**, which means data flows both ways between the JavaScript and the HTML template.

---

### Data Flow from JavaScript to HTML

- The `value` attribute of the input field is linked to a JavaScript property (e.g., `name`).
- This means that whatever value is stored in the JavaScript property is displayed in the input field.
- When the component loads or when the JavaScript property updates, the input field reflects the current value automatically.

### Data Flow from HTML to JavaScript

- The input field listens for changes (such as user typing).
- When the user changes the value inside the input, an event handler method in JavaScript is triggered.
- This method receives the new input value and updates the corresponding JavaScript property.
- Because the JavaScript property is reactive, updating it automatically updates the rest of the component where it is used.

### Summary

- **Two-way data binding** means the JavaScript property and the HTML input stay in sync.
- When the JavaScript value changes, the input field updates.
- When the user types in the input field, the JavaScript property updates.
- This synchronization ensures that the UI and the data model always reflect the same state.
